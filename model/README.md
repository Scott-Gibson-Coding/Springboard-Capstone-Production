Since tensorflow.js can load models build using other frameworks like
keras, I'm going to see if I can import and store a pretrained model
here, then convert it to a format tensorflow.js can understand.

The purpose of this will be to improve the control I have in swapping
out different models for the web app, and it will enable me to try my
hand at transfer learning and dataset manipulation, which is not something
I've used much for my end product in this capstone. The data collection
and experimentation part of my Capstone was mostly done when experimenting
and building a console-based prototype, but a pretrained model has been
used unaltered for the end product stored on AWS.
